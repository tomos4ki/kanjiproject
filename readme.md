kanji project was ade for personal use for reebering kanji.
if you want to use it you will need to install django by running this comand:
pip install django

then in the terminal in the kanjiproject folder just type :python manage.py runserver 
this will run the server in the url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/


you will be responsible of making every kanji/sentence[in future update] and it's translaton and it's examples. but this will make you at least remember that kanji/centence a little bit more.
